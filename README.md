# Array_methods

This repository contains simple examples and explanations for three commonly used JavaScript array methods:

map() - Creates a new array by transforming every element in the original array

filter() - Creates a new array with only elements that pass a test

reduce() - Reduces an array to a single value by executing a reducer function
